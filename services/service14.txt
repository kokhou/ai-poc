Service Name: Dentures

Dentures are removable prosthetic devices designed to replace missing teeth and are commonly used in cases of significant tooth loss. They help restore the ability to eat and speak properly and improve the wearer's facial appearance. Dentures can be complete or partial, depending on the individual's needs.

Key Benefits:

Improved Functionality: Dentures enable better chewing and speech, which can be hindered by missing teeth.
Enhanced Appearance: They restore the appearance of a full set of teeth, improving facial aesthetics and smile.
Support Facial Structure: Dentures help prevent facial muscles from sagging, which can occur with tooth loss.
Cost-Effective: They are generally more affordable than dental implants or bridges.
Adaptable: Dentures can be modified if additional teeth are lost or if the wearer's dental needs change.
Types of Dentures:

Complete Dentures: Used when all teeth are missing in the upper or lower jaw, or both.
Partial Dentures: Suitable for individuals who still have some natural teeth. These dentures fill in the spaces created by missing teeth and prevent other teeth from changing position.
Immediate Dentures: Placed immediately after teeth removal, offering the benefit of not having to be without teeth during the healing period. However, they may require more adjustments as the mouth heals.
Procedure:
The process of getting dentures involves several appointments over a few weeks. Dentists make a series of impressions of the jaw and take measurements of how the jaws relate to one another and how much space is between them. Models are created, and the patient will try these models several times so the shape, color, and fit can be assessed before the final denture is cast.

Risks and Considerations:
Adapting to dentures can take time, and they may initially cause soreness and slight difficulties with eating and speaking. Regular check-ups are necessary to adjust the fit. Poorly fitted dentures can lead to infections, mouth sores, or problems eating and speaking.

Aftercare:
Good oral hygiene is crucial, including cleaning the dentures daily and keeping the mouth clean. Regular dental check-ups are essential to ensure a proper fit over time.

Dentures are a practical solution for missing teeth, significantly improving oral functionality and appearance. They require proper care and regular dental visits to maintain their fit and function effectively.
