Service Name: Dental Bridges

Dental bridges are a form of dental restoration used to replace one or more missing teeth by anchoring an artificial tooth (or teeth) to adjacent natural teeth or dental implants. They span the space where teeth are missing and are cemented to the natural teeth or implants surrounding the empty space.

Key aspects of dental bridges include:

Types of Bridges:

Traditional Bridges: Involve creating a crown for the tooth or implant on either side of the missing tooth, with a pontic (artificial tooth) in between. The most common type of bridge.
Cantilever Bridges: Used when there are adjacent teeth on only one side of the missing tooth or teeth.
Maryland Bonded Bridges (also known as a resin-bonded bridge or a Maryland bridge): Made of porcelain, porcelain fused to metal, or plastic teeth and gums supported by a metal or porcelain framework. Metal or porcelain wings on each side of the bridge are bonded to your existing teeth.
Procedure:

Preparation of the Adjacent Teeth: The dentist reshapes these teeth by removing a portion of enamel to allow room for a crown to be placed over them.
Impressions: Impressions of the teeth are made, which serve as a model from which the bridge, pontic, and crowns will be made by a dental lab.
Temporary Bridge: A temporary bridge is set up to protect the exposed teeth and gums while the permanent bridge is being made.
Permanent Bridge Placement: Once the custom-made bridge is ready, the temporary bridge is removed, and the new bridge is adjusted as needed and cemented into place.
Benefits:

Bridges can restore your smile, the ability to properly chew and speak, and maintain the shape of your face.
They distribute the forces in your bite properly by replacing missing teeth and prevent remaining teeth from drifting out of position.
Care and Maintenance:

Good oral hygiene, including brushing and flossing, is vital to prevent tooth decay and gum disease that can lead to tooth loss, which affects the bridge.
Regular checkups and cleanings are also important.
Lifespan:

Dental bridges can last 5 to 15 years and even longer. With good oral hygiene and regular checkups, it is not unusual for the life span of a fixed bridge to be over 10 years.
Dental bridges are a time-tested solution for replacing missing teeth, significantly improving dental health and the aesthetics of a patient's smile. They are a less invasive and more cost-effective option than dental implants for many patients. However, the success and longevity of a bridge depend greatly on the health and maintenance of the anchoring teeth.
