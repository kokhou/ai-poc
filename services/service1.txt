Service Name: Routine Dental Exams

Routine dental exams are a fundamental part of maintaining oral health. They are typically recommended every six months, though the frequency can vary based on individual needs. During a routine dental exam, several key activities take place:

Visual Examination: The dentist examines teeth, gums, and the mouth for signs of cavities, gum disease, and other oral health issues. This includes checking for plaque and tartar buildup.

X-rays: Depending on the patient's age, risk of disease, and symptoms, dental X-rays may be taken to detect problems not visible during the visual examination, such as issues below the gum line, between teeth, or in the jaw.

Gum Health Assessment: The dentist may check the health of your gums, often using a special tool to measure the depth of the spaces between your teeth and gums. This helps in identifying gum diseases like gingivitis or periodontitis.

Cleaning: Professional cleaning, also known as prophylaxis, typically accompanies a routine exam. This involves removing plaque and tartar, polishing teeth, and may include flossing.

Oral Cancer Screening: Some dentists include an examination of the neck, lymph nodes, and oral cavity for signs of oral cancer, particularly if the patient has risk factors for this disease.

Education and Recommendations: Dentists often use this time to provide oral hygiene instructions, dietary advice, and recommendations for future treatments if needed.

Routine dental exams are crucial for early detection and treatment of oral health problems, and they contribute significantly to long-term dental health. Regular visits to the dentist can prevent the progression of oral diseases and reduce the need for more complex and expensive treatments in the future.
