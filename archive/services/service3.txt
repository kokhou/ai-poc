Service Name: Dental X-rays

Dental X-rays are a vital diagnostic tool used in dentistry to provide a detailed view of parts of the mouth that are not visible during a regular dental examination. These X-rays help dentists detect and treat dental problems at early stages, saving time, money, and discomfort for patients.

Key aspects of dental X-rays include:

Types of Dental X-rays:

Bitewing X-rays: Show details of the upper and lower teeth in a specific area of the mouth. They are used to detect decay between teeth and changes in bone density caused by gum disease.
Periapical X-rays: Show the entire tooth, from the exposed crown to the end of the root and the bones that support the tooth. These are used to detect dental problems below the gum line or in the jaw, such as impacted teeth, abscesses, cysts, tumors, and bone changes linked to some diseases.
Panoramic X-rays: Show a broad view of the jaws, teeth, sinuses, nasal area, and jaw joints, and are used to plan treatment for dental implants, check for impacted wisdom teeth, and detect jaw problems.
Frequency of X-rays: The frequency depends on the patient's individual health needs. Your dentist will recommend X-rays based on the review of your medical and dental history, a dental exam, signs and symptoms, age, and risk for disease.

Safety: Dental X-rays require very low levels of radiation exposure, making the risk of potentially harmful effects very small. Dental offices take necessary precautions to limit the patientâ€™s exposure to radiation, including using lead aprons and modern, fast film that reduces exposure time.

Use in Diagnosis and Treatment: X-rays can reveal dental issues such as cavities, hidden dental structures (like wisdom teeth), and bone loss that cannot be seen during a visual examination. They are crucial for planning many types of dental treatment, such as dental implants, orthodontic treatment, root canals, and extractions.

Digital X-rays: Many practices now use digital X-rays, which have several advantages over traditional film-based X-rays, including lower radiation exposure, the ability to view images immediately, and the ease of sharing digital images.

Regular dental X-rays are an essential component of comprehensive dental care, as they help dentists diagnose common problems, such as cavities, gum disease, and some types of infections. They provide valuable information that assists in the planning and effective treatment of dental issues.
