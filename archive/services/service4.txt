Service Name: Cavity Fillings

Cavity fillings are a common dental procedure used to repair teeth that have been damaged by decay. When a tooth develops a cavity, the decayed portion of the tooth must be removed and filled with a filling material. This process not only restores the tooth to its normal function and shape but also prevents further decay by closing off any spaces where bacteria can enter.

Key aspects of cavity fillings include:

Materials Used:

Amalgam (Silver) Fillings: Durable and resistant to wear, ideal for back teeth where chewing force is greatest. Composed of a mixture of metals including silver, mercury, tin, and copper.
Composite Resins: Tooth-colored fillings that are matched to the color of your teeth, making them less noticeable. Suitable for visible areas, but may not be as durable as metal fillings.
Gold Fillings: Made to order in a lab and then cemented into place. Gold inlays are well-tolerated by gum tissues and may last more than 20 years.
Porcelain Fillings: Also called inlays or onlays, are produced in a lab and then bonded to the tooth. They can be matched to the color of the tooth and resist staining.
Procedure:

The dentist will numb the area around the tooth with a local anesthetic.
Decay and any old filling material is removed using a drill, air abrasion instrument, or laser.
The space is cleaned and prepared for the filling.
If the decay is near the root, the dentist may first put in a liner made of glass ionomer, composite resin, or other material to protect the nerve.
The filling material is then applied, shaped, and polished.
Post-Treatment Care:

Patients may experience sensitivity to hot and cold in the days following the procedure, but this usually subsides.
Good oral hygiene, including regular brushing and flossing, is essential to maintain fillings and overall dental health.
Longevity and Maintenance:

The lifespan of a filling depends on the material used and the patient's oral hygiene.
Regular dental check-ups are important to monitor the condition of fillings and address any issues promptly.
Cavity fillings are a straightforward solution to restore decayed teeth and prevent further dental deterioration. The choice of filling material depends on the extent of repair needed, where in your mouth the filling is needed, the cost, and your insurance coverage. Regular dental visits are crucial for detecting cavities early and addressing them with fillings before more extensive dental work becomes necessary.
