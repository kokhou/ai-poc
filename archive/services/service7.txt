Service Name: Dental Crowns

Dental crowns are a type of dental restoration that completely cap or encircle a tooth or dental implant. Crowns are often needed when a large cavity threatens the ongoing health of a tooth or after a root canal treatment. They are also used to improve the strength or appearance of teeth.

Key aspects of dental crowns include:

Materials Used:

Porcelain or Ceramic: Used for front teeth due to their natural color and texture that match natural teeth.
Gold and Metal Alloys: Known for their durability and strength, making them suitable for back teeth.
Porcelain Fused to Metal: Offers both strength (due to the metal structure) and a tooth-like appearance (due to the porcelain coat).
Reasons for Use:

To protect a weak tooth from breaking or to hold together parts of a cracked tooth.
To cover and support a tooth with a large filling when there isn't a lot of tooth left.
To cover severely discolored or misshapen teeth.
To cover a dental implant.
To make a cosmetic modification.
Procedure:

Preparation: The dentist reshapes the tooth to make room for the crown. The amount removed depends on the type of crown used.
Impression: An impression is made to provide an exact model for the crown.
Temporary Crown: If the crown is fabricated in a laboratory, a temporary crown is made to cover and protect the prepared tooth while the crown is being made.
Permanent Crown Placement: Once the permanent crown is ready, the temporary crown is removed, and the new crown is adjusted as needed and then cemented into place.
Care and Maintenance:

Crowns require the same level of care as natural teeth, including brushing, flossing, and regular dental check-ups.
Although crowns are highly durable, they can sometimes break or come loose. Immediate consultation with a dentist is necessary if this occurs.
Lifespan:

Crowns generally last between 5 to 15 years, depending on the wear and tear they are exposed to and how well oral hygiene is maintained.
Dental crowns play a significant role in dental restoration and cosmetic dentistry. They restore the functionality, strength, and appearance of damaged teeth, enhancing oral health and the overall quality of life for the patient. Regular dental visits are essential for assessing the need for crowns and ensuring the longevity of the restoration.
