Service Name: Professional Teeth Cleaning

Professional teeth cleaning, also known as dental prophylaxis, is a routine procedure typically performed by a dental hygienist or dentist. It is an important part of maintaining good oral hygiene and is usually done during a regular dental visit. The primary purposes of professional teeth cleaning are to remove plaque, tartar (calculus), and stains that have accumulated on the teeth.

Key aspects of professional teeth cleaning include:

Plaque Removal: Plaque is a sticky, colorless film of bacteria and sugars that forms on the teeth. It is the leading cause of tooth decay and gum disease if not removed regularly through brushing, flossing, and professional cleanings.

Tartar Removal: Tartar, or calculus, is hardened plaque that has been left on the tooth for some time and is now firmly attached to the tooth surface. Tartar forms above and below the gum line and can only be removed with special dental instruments.

Teeth Polishing: After removing plaque and tartar, the teeth are polished to remove stains and any remaining plaque, making the surface of the teeth smooth and minimizing future plaque accumulation.

Education on Oral Hygiene: During the cleaning, the dental professional might also provide tips on maintaining good oral hygiene practices at home, including proper brushing and flossing techniques.

Assessment of Oral Health: Although not a replacement for a dental examination, professional cleaning often provides an opportunity for the dental professional to observe the health of your mouth and may identify areas of concern.

Regular professional teeth cleaning is crucial for preventing gum disease and tooth decay, and it is typically recommended every six months. However, some individuals might require more frequent cleanings, especially those with a history of periodontal disease. Regular cleanings, combined with good oral hygiene habits at home, form the foundation of a healthy mouth and a bright smile.
